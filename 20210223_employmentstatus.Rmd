## Employment Status

Data this week are sourced from Bureau of Labor Statistics.

## Load Libraries + Data

```{r prep}

library(tidyverse)

employed <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-23/employed.csv')

earn <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-23/earn.csv')

```

## Let's check out the data

Read in, clean it up.

```{r eda}
employed %>% glimpse()
employed %>% count(year)
employed %>% count(industry)
# Industry is messy/maybe some errors, need to filter a few things out (some race/gender categories)

earn %>% glimpse()
```

## Make the plot

Goal: thinking of making circle bar chart like [this](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/297-circular-barplot-with-groups.html), because it just sounds kinda fun/different. Select industry, year, industry total; get distinct; plot charts; facet by year.

So. I learned that coord_polar doesn't support free scales in faceting, so I'm pivoting. My original plan won't really look good/be readable at all, but I found a pretty ish view of the data with geom_col, but not really usable/insightful. So I'll share that since it's pretty, and then make a more basic plot of total employment by industry, over time.

```{r}

employed %>%
  filter(!industry %in% c('Men','Asian','Black or African American','Women','White')) %>%
  filter(!is.na(industry)) %>%
  # NEED TO DO THIS, OTHERWISE GET HUGE OVER-COUNTINGS (more reasonable now)
  filter(race_gender == 'TOTAL') %>%
  mutate(industry = case_when(
    str_detect(industry,'Mining') ~ 'Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction',
    str_detect(industry,'trade') ~ 'Wholesale and retail trade',
    str_detect(industry,'ther services') ~ 'Other services',
    TRUE ~ industry)) %>% 
  select(industry,industry_total,year) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(industry,year) %>%
  summarise(industry_total = sum(industry_total)) %>%
  # Checking we get more reasonable numbers for total employed counts (we good)
  #group_by(year) %>% summarise(dds = sum(industry_total))
  ggplot(aes(x=industry,y=industry_total,fill=as.factor(year))) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',position = 'dodge') +
#  geom_col(aes(y=industry_total,x=industry,fill=as.factor(year)),position = 'dodge') +
  theme_minimal() +
  #coord_polar() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~industry, scales = 'free')
```

First make the pretty (but not necessarily readable) chart:

```{r}
# copy geom_col from above, need to reformat theme stuff to make it look nice
```

Then make the nicer (analytics POV) looking plot:

```{r}
employed %>%
  filter(!industry %in% c('Men','Asian','Black or African American','Women','White')) %>%
  filter(!is.na(industry)) %>%
  # NEED TO DO THIS, OTHERWISE GET HUGE OVER-COUNTINGS (more reasonable now)
  filter(race_gender == 'TOTAL') %>%
  mutate(industry = case_when(
    str_detect(industry,'Mining') ~ 'Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction',
    str_detect(industry,'trade') ~ 'Wholesale and retail trade',
    str_detect(industry,'ther services') ~ 'Other services',
    TRUE ~ industry)) %>% 
  select(industry,industry_total,year) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(industry,year) %>%
  summarise(industry_total = sum(industry_total)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=industry_total,color=industry,label=industry,group=industry)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  directlabels::geom_dl(method = list(directlabels::dl.trans(x = x+0.2),'last.points',cex = 0.8)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') + ggsave('test.png')
```

## Different idea...

Inspired by that weird spray-painted flower Mams and Bops gave me in middle school.

```{r}
## Very important to set seed (before every run)! Otherwise get values alllll over the place!
set.seed(2)
